# Templating

There are two official middlewares built for templating for your Macaron application currently, which are [`macaron.Renderer`](https://gowalker.org/github.com/Unknwon/macaron#Renderer) and [`pongo2.Pongoer`](https://gowalker.org/github.com/macaron-contrib/pongo2#Pongoer).

You're free to choose them to use, but normally, one Macaron [Instance](../intro/core_concepts#instances) only uses one templating engine.
